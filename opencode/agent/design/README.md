# Design Agents

Specialized AI agents focused on user experience, interface design, and visual validation with test-driven design principles.

## Agents

### [UI/UX Designer](ui-ux-designer.md)
Expert in user-centered design, modern design systems, and accessible interface creation. Masters design tokens, component libraries, and inclusive design with comprehensive testing and validation.

### [UI Visual Validator](ui-visual-validator.md)
Rigorous visual validation expert specializing in UI testing, design system compliance, and accessibility verification. Masters automated testing tools and provides measurable quality assurance.

## Expertise Areas

- **Design Systems**: Token-based architecture, component libraries, multi-brand systems
- **User Research**: Qualitative/quantitative research, usability testing, validation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, inclusive design, automated testing
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison, regression testing, quality gates
- **Information Architecture**: Site mapping, navigation, content strategy
- **Interaction Design**: Micro-interactions, prototyping, user flows
- **Design Technology**: Figma, Storybook, Chromatic, accessibility tools

## Common Tasks

- Design system creation and maintenance
- Component library design with testing
- User research and validation
- Accessibility audits and compliance
- Visual regression testing
- Design-to-development handoff
- Cross-platform design consistency
- A/B testing and optimization

## Collaboration

Design agents often work with:
- **Engineering agents** for implementation and testing
- **Quality agents** for accessibility and validation
- **Content agents** for documentation and guidelines
- **Architecture agents** for system design decisions

## Test-Driven Design Philosophy

All design agents practice test-driven design:
- Define success criteria before designing
- Validate designs with user research
- Test with real users before implementation
- Measure design impact with analytics
- Iterate based on data and feedback
- Use automated testing for quality gates
