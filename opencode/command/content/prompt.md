Create, optimize, or evaluate LLM prompts using advanced prompting techniques and best practices.

IMPORTANT: Always display the complete prompt text in a clearly marked section. Never just describe a prompt.

Prompt Engineering Scope:
- Prompt design for specific use cases and models
- Chain-of-thought and reasoning optimization
- Constitutional AI and safety patterns
- Few-shot learning and example selection
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) integration
- Multi-agent and workflow prompts
- Production reliability and error handling

Advanced Techniques:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
- Zero-shot and few-shot patterns
- Constitutional AI self-correction
- Tree-of-thoughts for complex reasoning
- Meta-prompting and self-improvement
- Structured outputs and JSON mode
- Function calling optimization

Model-Specific Optimization:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o, o1-preview/mini)
- Anthropic Claude (3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus)
- Open source models (Llama, Mixtral, Qwen)
- Model parameter tuning (temperature, top_p, etc.)
- Token optimization for cost efficiency

Production Considerations:
- Safety and alignment
- Hallucination reduction
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Performance and latency
- Cost optimization
- A/B testing framework
- Version control strategy

Testing & Evaluation:
- Define success metrics and criteria
- Test with edge cases and adversarial inputs
- Measure accuracy and consistency
- Compare across multiple models
- Red team for vulnerabilities
- Statistical significance testing

Required Output Format:

### The Prompt
```
[Complete prompt text here - this is mandatory]
```

### Implementation Notes
- Techniques used and rationale
- Model-specific optimizations
- Expected behavior and outputs
- Parameter recommendations

### Testing Strategy
- Test cases and evaluation metrics
- Edge cases and failure modes
- A/B testing approach

### Usage Guidelines
- When to use this prompt
- Customization options
- Production integration notes

Provide:
- Complete, copy-paste ready prompt text
- Clear implementation guidance
- Testing and evaluation framework
- Safety and ethical considerations
- Cost and performance estimates
- Version control recommendations

Focus on production-ready prompts that are reliable, safe, and optimized for your specific use case.
