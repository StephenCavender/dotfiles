Analyze and improve developer experience, tooling, and workflows for maximum productivity.

Developer Experience Audit Areas:

Environment Setup:
- Onboarding time (target: < 5 minutes from clone to running app)
- Dependency installation and management
- Environment configuration and secrets
- Documentation quality and completeness
- Common setup errors and troubleshooting

Development Workflows:
- Build time optimization (current vs target)
- Test execution speed and feedback loops
- Hot reload and development server performance
- Git workflow and branching strategy
- Code generation and scaffolding tools

Tooling Assessment:
- IDE configuration and extensions
- Linting and formatting setup
- Git hooks and pre-commit checks
- CLI tools and custom scripts
- Development automation opportunities

Documentation Review:
- README clarity and completeness
- Setup guides accuracy
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Code comments and inline help
- Architecture decision records

Friction Points Analysis:
- Identify repetitive manual tasks
- Common error messages and solutions
- Development bottlenecks
- Team workflow pain points
- Missing automation opportunities

Success Metrics:
- Time from clone to first PR
- Build/test execution time
- Developer satisfaction score
- Setup error rate
- Time spent on tooling vs features

Optimization Recommendations:
- Quick wins (< 1 hour implementation)
- Medium-term improvements (1-5 hours)
- Long-term enhancements (> 5 hours)
- Automation opportunities
- Tooling upgrades or additions

Deliverables:
- DX audit report with metrics
- Prioritized improvement roadmap
- Automation scripts and tooling configs
- Updated documentation
- IDE/editor configuration files
- Custom CLI commands or shortcuts
- Git hooks and quality gates
- Benchmark comparisons (before/after)

Provide:
- Current state analysis with measurements
- Specific friction points with impact assessment
- Actionable recommendations prioritized by ROI
- Implementation guides for improvements
- Success metrics and tracking approach

Focus on invisible improvements that save time and reduce frustration.
