Create, audit, or enhance a design system with comprehensive accessibility and testing.

Design System Scope:
- Design token architecture (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
- Component library design and specifications
- Accessibility guidelines and WCAG compliance
- Responsive breakpoint strategy
- Dark mode and theming support
- Icon system and visual assets
- Animation and interaction patterns
- Brand consistency and style guide

Test-Driven Design Approach:
- Define success metrics before designing
- Create accessibility test criteria (contrast ratios, keyboard navigation)
- Establish design validation checkpoints
- Plan user research and testing strategy
- Set up visual regression testing framework
- Document component testing requirements

Deliverables:
- Design token specifications with validation rules
- Component library with usage guidelines
- Accessibility compliance checklist
- Design-to-development handoff documentation
- Testing and validation framework
- User research findings and validation
- Figma/design tool setup with proper organization

Validation Requirements:
- All colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- Components tested with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation fully functional
- Responsive behavior validated across breakpoints
- Visual regression tests configured
- Design tokens integrated with code

Provide:
- Comprehensive design system documentation
- Component specifications with states and variants
- Accessibility implementation guide
- Design validation checklist
- Integration guidelines for developers
- Maintenance and versioning strategy

Focus on systematic, scalable, and accessible design solutions with comprehensive testing.
